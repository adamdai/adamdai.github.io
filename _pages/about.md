I am a 4th year PhD candidate at Stanford under Prof. Grace Gao in the [Navigation and Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/). 
My research focuses on motion planning and SLAM for robots using reachability and geometric representations.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->
