I am a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University under Prof. Grace Gao in the Navigation and Autonomous Vehicles Lab ([NAV Lab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/)). 
My research lies at the intersection of mapping and motion planning for autonomous robots.
My goal is to use mathematical tools, such as reachability analysis and set-based representations, to develop algorithms that integrate mapping and motion planning, steps which are typically performed separately in autonomous robots.

I'm from Santa Barbara, CA and I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Caltech in 2019. 
I fell in love with robots through FIRST Robotics in high school, and went on to also compete in the RoboSub competition through the robotics team at Caltech. 
I swam competitively from middle school through college, and currently enjoy surfing and reading in my free time.
